# ASUbuildR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

ASUbuildR provides a GUI interface to equip state to more easily
generate Areas of Substantial Unemployment (ASU) that maximize
unemploymnet within ASUs in a state. This package depends on receiving
an Excel file from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics which includes
their tract-level labor force estimates reflecting the twelve months
ending in June, with preliminary estimates for June, revised estimates
for January-May, and benchmarked estimates for July-December in the
prior year.

## Common issues

- This will only work on Windows computers with x64 architecture (this is the most common in modern times)  
- I recommend unzipping into a directory in your main drive  
- For larger states, map rendering can be a bit slow — just give it a couple minutes
